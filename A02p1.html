		  <p>First page: select category</p>
		<p>This page fulfills the functional requirements of the site by enabling the user to 
		easily complete one of the steps of posting an item: choosing the category in which their 
		item belongs. Allowing the user to easily pick the right category lets the site display the 
		user’s advertisement for the right audience.</p>
		<p>This page fulfills content requirements by providing the main categories in which “For Sale” 
		items generally fall. The organization of the categories is similar to that which is displayed 
		when a user browses the “For Sale” section, making it familiar and easier to navigate for those 
		whom have browsed the “For Sale” section before. The grouping of similar subsections and the 
		alphabetical ordering of subsections creates visual organization to help the user find their 
		desired category.</p>
